# Lix Cache - What We're Building

## The Problem
Every TypeScript developer uses Redis or Memcached for caching, but the experience is terrible:
- **No type safety** - Everything is a string, manual JSON parsing
- **Cryptic errors** - "WRONGTYPE Operation against wrong value"
- **Manual everything** - Serialization, retries, connection management
- **Zero IDE help** - No autocomplete, no inline docs

Developers waste hours debugging cache-related bugs that TypeScript should prevent.

## The Solution
**Lix Cache**: A caching system designed specifically for TypeScript developers, where developer experience is the #1 priority.

## What Makes Lix Special

### 1. Perfect TypeScript Integration
```typescript
// Set a value - types are remembered
await lix.set('user', { name: 'Alice', age: 30 });

// Get it back - fully typed automatically!
const user = await lix.get('user');  
// TypeScript knows: { name: string; age: number } | null
```

### 2. Zero Configuration
```bash
npx lix-cache             # Server starts automatically
npm install lix-cache     # SDK ready to use
```
No connection strings. No config files. It just works.

### 3. Invisible Intelligence
The SDK automatically:
- **Batches requests** - Multiple gets become one network call
- **Caches locally** - Recently used values served from memory
- **Retries failures** - With exponential backoff
- **Deduplicates** - Same request twice = one network call

All without any configuration.

### 4. Errors That Teach
Instead of cryptic errors, you get helpful guidance showing exactly what went wrong and how to fix it.

## Technical Architecture

### Backend (Elixir - ‚úÖ Already Built)
- **200 lines of code** using Plug + Cachex
- **4 HTTP endpoints** (get/set/delete/batch)
- **Handles 100k+ ops/sec** on a single node
- **Automatic TTL** and memory management

### Frontend (TypeScript SDK - üìù To Build)
- **Type-safe client** with full inference
- **Request batching** to reduce network calls
- **Client-side caching** with configurable TTL
- **Beautiful error messages** that help developers
- **React/Next.js integrations** (hooks, middleware)

## Why This Wins

**Current cache experience:**
```typescript
// Redis today - no types, manual everything
const userJson = await redis.get('user:1');  // string | null
const user = JSON.parse(userJson || '{}');   // any - hope for the best!
```

**Lix Cache experience:**
```typescript
// Full type safety, automatic everything
const user = await lix.get<User>('user:1');  // User | null - guaranteed!
```

## The Business Case

- **10 million TypeScript developers** worldwide
- **Every project needs caching** eventually
- **Current solutions optimize for ops teams**, not developers
- **We optimize for developer joy** ‚Üí word-of-mouth growth

## Success Metrics

- **60 seconds** from install to first cache operation
- **100% type coverage** with zero type annotations needed
- **80% fewer cache-related bugs** in production
- **10/10 developer satisfaction** score

- Debug mode with insights

### Week 3: Polish & Launch
- Documentation
- Examples
- NPM publish
- Show HackerNews

## The Vision

We're not building a better cache. We're building a cache that makes developers smile.

Every time a developer uses Lix Cache, they should think "why isn't everything this nice to use?"

---

**TL;DR:** Lix Cache is the TypeScript-first cache that developers have been waiting for - one that respects their time, prevents their bugs, and sparks joy in daily use.
